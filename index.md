I am an Assistant Professor of Economics at the [University of Alabama at Birmingham's Collat School of Business](https://www.uab.edu/business/home/).

My research interests lie at the intersection of **Labor Economics** and **Applied Econometrics**, where I examine how large-scale disruptions reshape labor market structures, with a focus on immigration flows, environmental crises, and gender dynamics.

Currently, I am interested in difference-in-difference settings where time-varying covariates may be influenced by the treatment, but they are still crucial for the identification strategy.
