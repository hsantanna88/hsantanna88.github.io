🐲I an Assistant Professor of Economics at the [University of Alabama at Birmingham's Collat School of Business](https://www.uab.edu/business/home/).🐲

My research interests lie at the intersection of **Labor Economics** and **Applied Econometrics**, where I examine how large-scale disruptions reshape labor market structures, with a focus on immigration flows, environmental crises, and gender dynamics.

I also study methodological challenges in settings where covariates may be influenced by treatment effects in Difference-in-Differences.
